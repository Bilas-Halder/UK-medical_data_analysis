###
On the hospital data, we want to run an analysis similar to the price sensitivity analysis we did for Spring.

#
So we need the file "AAE Monthly Provider Data"

#
Then from that column for each provider we just need columns
AandE_Attends_Type1
Attends_Under_4Hrs_Arr_To_Adm_Tfr_Disch_Type1
Attends_Over_4Hrs_Arr_To_Adm_Tfr_Disch_Type1

#
Now, I know that for
Attends_Under_4Hrs_Arr_To_Adm_Tfr_Disch_Type1

we have NULL values, but we can calculate this by:
"AandE_Attends_Type1" - "Attends_Over_4Hrs_Arr_To_Adm_Tfr_Disch_Type1"

##
Then what I need is the following:

#
For each row calculate "% Attends_Under_4Hrs_Arr_To_Adm_Tfr_Disch_Type1"

This we calculate by doing this:
Attends_Under_4Hrs_Arr_To_Adm_Tfr_Disch_Type1 / AandE_Attends_Type1

#
Then do the following:
For each Provider_Code I want the average monthly value for "AandE_Attends_Type1"

#
This average value we will make our reference point 0

#
Then for make all other values, round to 1% point positive and negative

***
If you look at this file and look at "My Calculation" sheet, then you can get an idea of what I am discussing

So obviously we need to do for all "Provider_Code".


###
Then If you can do an average of all the average;
So, for each % point on "% Difference" in my sheet, do the average "% Attends_Under_4Hrs_Arr_To_Adm_Tfr_Disch_Type1" for all the "Provider_Code"
